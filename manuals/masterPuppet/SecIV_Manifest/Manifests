Resource => Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

	Puppet translates these "resource" into "providers" which 
	are platform specific procedures 

	package
	->	yum
	->	apt
	->	zypper

	Example of a "Resource"

		user {'devops':                     type {'name':

			uid => '5001',						properties
			gid => '5001',
			home => '/home/devops',			}
			shell => '/bin/bash',
			ensure => present,
		}

	Here is a longer example that can also be found on the puppet.doc

	user { 'resource title':

Manifests Continued...

	- mainfest are files which contain collection of resources
	- written to achieve a specific objective
	- have .pp extension
	- resources in a manifest can be applied in any node


Applying Puppet Manifest Locally

	//Add commands

Idempotence and Convergence

	Work Flow

		load facts -> cleans cache -> compile catalog -> converge/apply ->  report

	Convergence

		Puppet takes a convergent approach to configuration

			- by defining the policy
			- by comparing current state of the infrastructre
			- bring it in-line with the policy
			- taking action or not taking action
			- puppet resources are idempotent (most)
